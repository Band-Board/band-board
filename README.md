The App:
---------
BandBoard is an application created in order to conveniently view tour information
for your favorite bands, and to be aware of when they will be "in town". The application
provides users with a list of user-created bands that can then be added to a user's
watch-list. These bands can also be individually viewed to see all of their show dates on a calendar with location. A user can then view a user-specific calendar that will be populated by local tourdates
of their watch-listed bands.

-------
